## Captions
The captions file is there to shed some context and explain the images. It lifts verbatum the original captions accompanying these images from my thesis.

## Tex-Templates
For the images that were completed using tex, you might find counterpart files in my [Tex Templates Directory](https://github.com/Spitfire-Frozone/Tex-Templates) such that you can replicate similar images for yourself. I'm no expert, but you can use these as a starting point.
